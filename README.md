# React Native AI Chat Bot App With Server Side Streaming (SSE) with Express JS

In this post, I have discussed how you can implement Server Side Streaming in React Native with OpenAI's APIs or your own LLMs.

I have made the backend with Express JS and have explained each and every line required to make both the frontend and backend work.

I have used the react-native-sse library to consume the server side event powered apis in your app.

I have discussed how you can use ChatGPTs completion API as well as dived into the concepts on how you can use assistant apis to make a even better chat bot with knowledge base.

Do let me know how it is and let me know if you want to make a chatbot in React Native with streaming capabilities for your own projects.
